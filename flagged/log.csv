Chapter 2

 Chinese


Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however (N.B. I dine between twelve and one o''clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five), on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles'' walk, arrived at Heathcliff''s garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.

On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.

`Wretched inmates!'' I ejaculated mentally, `you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day time. I don''t care--I will get in!'' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently. Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.

`Whet are ye for?'' he shouted. `T'' maister''s dahn i'' t'' fowld. Go rahnd by th'' end ut'' laith, if yah went tuh spake tull him.''

`Is there nobody inside to open the door?'' I hallooed, responsively.

`They''s nobbut t'' missis; and shoo''ll nut oppen''t an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght.''

`Why? Cannot you tell her who I am, eh, Joseph?''

`Nor-ne me! Aw''ll hae noa hend wi''t,'' muttered the head, vanishing.

The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal shed, pump, and pigeon cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment, where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the `missis'', an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.

`Rough weather!'' I remarked. `I''m afraid, Mrs Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants'' leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.''

She never opened her mouth. I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.

`Sit down,'' said the young man gruffly. `He''ll be in soon.''

I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.

`A beautiful animal!'' I commenced again. `Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?''

`They are not mine,'' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.

`Ah, your favourites are among these?'' I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.

`A strange choice of favourites!'' she observed scornfully.

Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.

`You should not have come out,'' she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.

Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, they would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn, and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his gold.

`I don''t want your help,'' she snapped; `I can get them for myself.''

`I beg your pardon!'' I hastened to reply.

`Were you asked to tea?'' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.

`I shall be glad to have a cup,'' I answered.

`Were you asked?'' she repeated.

`No,'' I said, half smiling. `You are the proper person to ask me.''

第二章

 英文


昨天下午又冷又有雾。我想就在书房炉边消磨一下午，不想踩着杂草污泥到呼啸山庄了。

但是，吃过午饭（注意——我在十二点与一点钟之间吃午饭，而可以当作这所房子的附属物的管家婆，一位慈祥的太太却不能，或者并不愿理解我请求在五点钟开饭的用意），在我怀着这个懒惰的想法上了楼，迈进屋子的时候，看见一个女仆跪在地上，身边是扫帚和煤斗。她正在用一堆堆煤渣封火，搞起一片弥漫的灰尘。这景象立刻把我赶回头了。我拿了帽子，走了四里路，到达了希刺克厉夫的花园口口，刚好躲过了一场今年初降的鹅毛大雪。

在那荒凉的山顶上，土地由于结了一层黑冰而冻得坚硬，冷空气使我四肢发抖。我弄不开门链，就跳进去，顺着两边种着蔓延的醋栗树丛的石路跑去。我白白地敲了半天门，一直敲到我的手指骨都痛了，狗也狂吠起来。

“倒霉的人家！”我心里直叫，“只为你这样无礼待客，就该一辈子跟人群隔离。我至少还不会在白天把门闩住。我才不管呢——我要进去！”如此决定了。我就抓住门闩，使劲摇它。苦脸的约瑟夫从谷仓的一个圆窗里探出头来。

“你干吗？”他大叫。“主人在牛栏里，你要是找他说话，就从这条路口绕过去。”

“屋里没人开门吗？”我也叫起来。

“除了太太没有别人。你就是闹腾到夜里，她也不会开。”

“为什么？你就不能告诉她我是谁吗，呃，约瑟夫？”

“别找我！我才不管这些闲事呢，”这个脑袋咕噜着，又不见了。

雪开始下大了。我握住门柄又试一回。这时一个没穿外衣的年轻人，扛着一根草耙，在后面院子里出现了。他招呼我跟着他走，穿过了一个洗衣房和一片铺平的地，那儿有煤棚、抽水机和鸽笼，我们终于到了我上次被接待过的那间温暖的、热闹的大屋子。煤、炭和木材混合在一起燃起的熊熊炉火，使这屋子放着光彩。在准备摆上丰盛晚餐的桌旁，我很高兴地看到了那位“太太”，以前我从未料想到会有这么一个人存在的。我鞠躬等候，以为她会叫我坐下。她望望我，往她的椅背一靠，不动，也不出声。

“天气真坏！”我说，“希刺克厉夫太太，恐怕大门因为您的仆人偷懒而大吃苦头，我费了好大劲才使他们听见我敲门！”

她死不开口。我瞪眼——她也瞪眼。反正她总是以一种冷冷的、漠不关心的神气盯住我，使人十分窘，而且不愉快。

“坐下吧，”那年轻人粗声粗气地说，“他就要来了。”

我服从了；轻轻咳了一下，叫唤那恶狗朱诺。临到第二次会面，它总算赏脸，摇起尾巴尖，表示认我是熟人了。

“好漂亮的狗！”我又开始说话。“您是不是打算不要这些小的呢，夫人？”

“那些不是我的，”这可爱可亲的女主人说，比希刺克厉夫本人所能回答的腔调还要更冷淡些。

“啊，您所心爱的是在这一堆里啦！”我转身指着一个看不清楚的靠垫上那一堆像猫似的东西，接着说下去。

“谁会爱这些东西那才怪呢！”她轻蔑地说。

倒霉，原来那是堆死兔子。我又轻咳一声，向火炉凑近些，又把今晚天气不好的话评论一通。

“你本来就不该出来。”她说，站起来去拿壁炉台上的两个彩色茶叶罐。

她原先坐在光线被遮住的地方，现在我把她的全身和面貌都看得清清楚楚。她苗条，显然还没有过青春期。挺好看的体态，还有一张我生平从未有幸见过的绝妙的小脸蛋。五官纤丽，非常漂亮。淡黄色的卷发，或者不如说是金黄色的，松松地垂在她那细嫩的颈上。至于眼睛，要是眼神能显得和悦些，就要使人无法抗拒了。对我这容易动情的心说来倒是常事，因为它们所表现的只是在轻蔑与近似绝望之间的一种情绪，而在那张脸上看见那样的眼神是特别不自然的。

她简直够不到茶叶罐。我动了一动，想帮她一下。她猛地扭转身向我，像守财奴看见别人打算帮他数他的金子一样。

“我不要你帮忙，”她怒气冲冲地说，“我自己拿得到。”

“对不起！”我连忙回答。

“是请你来吃茶的吗？”她问，把一条围裙系在她那干净的黑衣服上，就这样站着，拿一匙茶叶正要往茶壶里倒。

“我很想喝杯茶。”我回答。

“是请你来的吗？”她又问。

“没有，”我说，勉强笑一笑。“您正好请我喝茶。”
